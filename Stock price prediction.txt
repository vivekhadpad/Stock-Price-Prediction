Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and complex nature of the financial markets. This project aims to predict the stock prices using machine learning techniques. The prediction will help investors make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

Objectives
Collect historical stock price data.
Preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data.
Build and evaluate different machine learning models for stock price prediction.
Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
Project Plan
